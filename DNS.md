hello. 

These are the steps to create a Domain name. 

Domain name gives your website a desired name.

This desired name can be used to access your website instead of using the Public DNS
provided on amazon EC2 instance.

There are many domian name providers that you can choose from.
I have chosen Godaddy to be my domain name provider.
