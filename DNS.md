These are the steps to create a Domain name.

This desired name can be used to access your website instead of using the Public DNS

Search up for any Domain name that you prefer or you feel that will be suitable for your website. Make sure that you set a price range for the Domain name.

Setting a Price range is important as you would want to have a budget for your Domain name purchase. 

The cheapest Domain name according to your preference would be sufficient.
