Hi 

### why scripting

Scripting is used to automate tasks repeatedly (eg: New updates, creating files, deleting file)

This is a script that I am implementing on my blog page

I am using a script to automate the updates on my webserver, this is because i have only planned to use my Blog page three times a week and it would be an hassle to login everyday to update new packages. Therefore, i am using a script to update any new packages everyday.
